## Architecture

### Decision-Making Components

#### Game State Tracker
Maintains game history and analyzes patterns:
- **Historical Data**: Tracks up to 100 game state snapshots
- **Player Analysis**: Monitors opponent behavior and infers strategies
- **Market Trends**: Tracks resource prices and supply/demand patterns
- **Phase Statistics**: Analyzes game flow and timing

#### Decision Engine
Sophisticated move evaluation system:
- **Power Plant Evaluation**: Scores plants based on capacity, efficiency, resource availability, and synergy
- **Resource Optimization**: Prioritizes purchases based on scarcity and price trends
- **City Selection**: Evaluates strategic value, connection costs, and regional control
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Adjusts strategy based on game phase and player position

#### Game Monitor
Real-time game tracking:
- **Completion Detection**: Monitors win conditions and game end states
- **Statistics Collection**: Tracks turns, phases, actions, and resource usage
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures game duration and player effectiveness

### Statistics and Reporting

The simulation framework generates comprehensive reports including:

1. **Overall Statistics**
   - Total games, completion rate, average duration
   - Success/failure analysis

2. **Strategy Performance**
   - Win rates, average cities, resource usage
   - Comparative analysis between strategies

3. **Phase Analysis**
   - Phase frequency and duration
   - Action patterns per phase

4. **Resource Trends**
   - Total consumption by type
   - Peak demand analysis
   - Market volatility

5. **Key Insights**
   - Dominant strategies
   - Performance anomalies
   - Optimization recommendations

## Development

### Adding New Strategies

1. **Create Strategy**: Implement the `Strategy` interface in `internal/ai/strategy.go`
```go
type NewStrategy struct{}

func (s *NewStrategy) GetName() string {
    return "NewStrategy"
}

func (s *NewStrategy) GetDescription() string {
    return "Description of strategy behavior"
}

func (s *NewStrategy) GetMove(gameState *protocol.GameStatePayload, playerID string) *protocol.Message {
    // Basic strategy logic
    // For advanced logic, use DecisionEngine
}
```

2. **Register Strategy**: Add to `CreateStrategy()` function
3. **Add Color**: Define color in `getColorForStrategy()`
4. **Test**: Use with AI clients and simulations

### Enhancing Decision Logic

To improve AI decision-making:

1. **Extend Evaluation Functions**
```go
// In decision_engine.go
func (e *DecisionEngine) evaluateCustomFactor(state *protocol.GameStatePayload) float64 {
    // Add new evaluation criteria
}
```

2. **Add Historical Analysis**
```go
// In game_state_tracker.go
func (t *GameStateTracker) analyzePattern() PatternResult {
    // Implement pattern recognition
}
```

3. **Implement Learning**
```go
// Create new learning module
type LearningEngine struct {
    history []GameResult
    weights map[string]float64
}
```

### Monitoring and Debugging

#### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor server logs
tail -f logs/server.log

# Monitor all logs with colors
./scripts/view_logs.sh

# Monitor specific AI strategy
grep "AI:AGGRESSIVE" logs/*.log
```

#### Game State Analysis
```bash
# Run with debug logging
./cmd/ai_client/ai_client -log-level=debug -strategy=aggressive

# Show caller information
./cmd/ai_client/ai_client -show-caller -log-level=debug
```

### Integration with Testing

The AI system integrates with existing test infrastructure:

```bash
# Run tests with AI clients
make test-e2e-all

# Custom test scenarios
./scripts/test_full_game_e2e.sh -ai 4 -strategies "aggressive,conservative"
```

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- Each AI client uses minimal CPU when idle
- Memory usage scales with game state complexity
- Network traffic is optimized through WebSocket connections

### Scalability
- Server supports up to 500 concurrent connections
- Recommended: Max 20 concurrent AI clients per server
- Simulation framework can handle 100+ games sequentially

### Optimization Tips
- Use shorter think times (`-d 100ms`) for faster simulations
- Enable concurrent mode (`-c`) for bulk testing
- Reduce log level (`-l warn`) for performance testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Failed**
```bash
# Check server status
curl http://localhost:4080/health

# Start server if needed
make run
```

**Build Errors**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
make clean
make build-ai-all
```

**Performance Issues**
```bash
# Reduce concurrent connections
./scripts/launch_ai_clients.sh -n 2

# Increase think time
./scripts/launch_ai_clients.sh -d 2s
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable detailed logging
./cmd/ai_client/ai_client -log-level=debug -show-caller

# Monitor WebSocket traffic
./cmd/ai_client/ai_client -log-level=debug | grep "WebSocket"
```
